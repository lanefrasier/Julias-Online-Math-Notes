### Definitions

Radius of convergence: the distance from the series' center to the boundary of the largest open disk (or interval) within which the power series converges to a finite sum. Inside this disk (for complex-valued series) or interval (for real-valued series), the series converges, and outside it, it diverges. If the series converges for all values of x, then R = âˆž, and if it only converges at its center, then R = 0.

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)$
