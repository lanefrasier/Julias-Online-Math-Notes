### Definitions

> $F = ma$<br>
F = Force = push/pull on an object<br>
Net Force = Sum of all forces on an object<br>
A = acceleration = how much the object speeds up/slows down<br>
Field = empty space around an object where a non-contact force (gravity, electric, magnetic) could exist<br>
1. Gravitational - around objects with mass
2. Electric - objects with charge
3. Magnetic - objects with magnetic forces
Electromagnet - materials that become magnets in presence of electricity<br>
Kinetic energy = $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$<br>
Wave - a disturbance that can propagate<br>
1. mechanical waves travel through a medium
Transfers energy without moving matter<br>

Period T[s] - time it takes for one wave cycle to complete
wavelength $\lambda$[m] - distance between identical points on adjacent waves
Frequency $f [\frac{cycles}{s} = Hz]$ - wave cycles per second
Speed = $v[\frac{distance}{time}]$ = velocity = $\vec{v} = \frac{\Delta \vec{x}}{\Delta t}$
$v = \lambda[\frac{distance}{cycle}] \cdot f[\frac{cycle}{time}] = \lambda \cdot f [\frac{m}{s}]$<br>
Factors affecting wave speed
1. Wave type
   1. EM faster than sound wave
2. Medium
   1. Sound faster in water than air
Larger $f$ -> larger energy<br>
energy = amplitude$^2$<br>
