### Definitions

>**Force**

A push or pull on an object. Force is a vector quantity with both magnitude and direction.<br>
$F = ma$

>**Net Force**

Sum of all forces on an object<br>
$\sum{\vec{F}}$<br>

>**Speed**

The rate at which an object covers distance, or the distance traveled per unit of time.<br>
$s = \frac{distance}{time}$

>**Position**

The location of an object in space at a given time, relative to a reference point (or origin).<br>
$r(t)$

>**Velocity**

A vector quantity that describes both the speed and direction of an object's motion<br>
$v(t) = \frac{dr}{dt}$
$\vec{v} = \frac{\Delta \vec{x}}{\Delta t}$<br>

>**Acceleration**

The rate at which an object's velocity changes over time<br>
$a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^{2}r}{dt^2}$<br>
$\vec{a} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_{f} - v_{i}}{\Delta t}$

### Fields

An empty space around an object where a non-contact force (gravity, electric, magnetic) could exist<br>

>**Scalar Fields**
 
A single numerical value (a scalar) at each point in space. Examples include temperature, density, and pressure <br>

>**Vector Fields**

These fields have both a magnitude (strength) and a direction at each point in space. Examples include velocity, force, and electric field<br>

>**Tensor Fields**

The most general type, encompassing scalar and vector fields as special cases. They describe quantities that require multiple components to be fully represented, often involving relationships between different directions. Examples include stress-energy tensor in general relativity and inertia tensor. <br>

1. Gravitational - around objects with mass
2. Electric - objects with charge
3. Magnetic - objects with magnetic forces
Electromagnet - materials that become magnets in presence of electricity<br>
Kinetic energy = $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$<br>
Wave - a disturbance that can propagate<br>
1. mechanical waves travel through a medium
Transfers energy without moving matter<br>
<img src="Images/wave.png" width="420"><br>
Period T[s] - time it takes for one wave cycle to complete
wavelength $\lambda$[m] - distance between identical points on adjacent waves
Frequency $f [\frac{cycles}{s} = Hz]$ - wave cycles per second
Speed = $v[\frac{distance}{time}]$ = velocity = $\vec{v} = \frac{\Delta \vec{x}}{\Delta t}$
$v = \lambda[\frac{distance}{cycle}] \cdot f[\frac{cycle}{time}] = \lambda \cdot f [\frac{m}{s}]$<br>
Factors affecting wave speed
1. Wave type
   1. EM faster than sound wave
2. Medium
   1. Sound faster in water than air
Larger $f$ -> larger energy<br>
energy = amplitude$^2$<br>
Light (Electromagnetic Waves):
Frequency = color
amplitude - brightness
Sound (Mechanical Waves):
Frequency = pitch
amplitude = Loudness
Transmission - wave travels through a medium
Higher frequencies bent more with refraction
Reflection: Wave bounces off a boundary
Absorption: Wave loses energy as it transmits into a material
As a wave loses energy, the amplitude decreases
Sound:
1. Analog - continuous, infinite values
2. Digital - discrete, finite values<br>

### Forces

Applied = $F_{A}$ Push/Pull
Tension = $F_{T}$ Pull - strings/rope
Gravitational (weight) = $F_{G}$ pull
Normal $\perp : F_{N}$ push
Frictional = $F{f}$ Push - opposite direction of motion<br>
Thrust = $F_{Th}$ push
Drag = $F_{d}$ Drag - air resistance, opposite direction of motion<br>
Buoyant = $F_{b}$ push - floating in water or a balloon
Lift = $F_{L}$ Push - planes
Force = vector, unit Newton (N)

Acceleration = $\vec{a} = \frac{{}\sum \vec{F}}{m}$<br>
$F{g} = mg$ where g = 9.8$m/s^2$<br>
Momentum = $\vec{\rho} = m \vec{v} \frac{kgm}{s}$<br>
$\sum \vec{F} = \frac{\Delta \vec{\rho}}{\Delta t}$<br>
